## User Story
```
AS someone new in a city we often WANT to socialize and easily find places depending on our mood SO as to be able to action and channel those feelings and satisfy our needs and desires by visiting nearby places. The following "I'm Feeling" App allows users to search for places relevant to their mood/feeling. 
```

## Project Requirements

As a group we were required to use everything we’ve learnt over the past six units to create a real-world front-end application that we’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The project must fulfil the following requirements:
```
✔️ Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap. 👉 Materialize
✔️ Be deployed to GitHub Pages. 👉See Project Resources section up top
✔️ Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input). 👉User can click feeling buttons
✔️ Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources). 👉We've used Places,Map and Quotation API's
✔️ Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals). 👉Used Modals
✔️ Use client-side storage to store persistent data. 👉 Used to store browser lat and long
✔️ Be responsive. 👉Used Materialize for responsiveness on small, medium, large screens
✔️ Have a polished UI. 👉Done
✔️ Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.). 👉 Done
✔️ Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application). 👉Done
```

## Presentation Requirements

Concept 📖: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
Process ♻️: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
Demo 💻: Show your stuff!
Directions for Future ⏭️ Development
Links 🔗: to the deployed application and the GitHub repository
